# Ipp Project
## Brief Intro
&emsp;A project to build more projects.
## Background
&emsp;As college members, our minds are free to do anything just that is legal. But with each one\`s mind alone, the effort he can make has a limit. If we want to do something bigger, we need to gether our minds in some convincing methods.  
&emsp;Once our multi-participant project starts, there is a important task that is to maintain active for the project. If it\`s a long term or somehow large project, when the main  dev is off his duty, or all the other participants lose their interest, this project will naturally die, or someone can put this project in a reactivation program. 
## Activities
### 1.Ideathon
&emsp;Hold a contest for ideas. And get votes for interest ideas, then the ideas of top n votes will become projects that can register for participants.
### 2.Build Up Communities
&emsp;Once the project is started, there is another job to build a community for it. The community will consist of developers, observers, testers and even users. The project members are not only responsible for development, but also need to share the project information like jobs assignment, progress, achievement, messages for new releases and even the technique report or blog post for the project. Media to share the project information can be either github page, social media account, website or blog.
